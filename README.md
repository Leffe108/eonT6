# eonT6
A dice emulator for the RPG Eon

Everything is in one file on purpous.

Jut download eonT6.html and open it with your favourite browser.

You can enter ether numbers or equations as "Number_of_T6" and "Extra". If your your "Extra" is less then 0 or more than 3, this little program will re calculate the number of dices according to Eon rules.
As an example, if you ender:

Number_of_T6: 3+2
Extra: -1

This will be recalculated to:

Number_of_T6: 4
Extra: 3

This program will always do ob-rolles acoring to Eon rules. This means that if the oucome of a dice is 6, this will not be counted, but instead two new dices arr rolled.

All deces are displayed.

Previous result are saved i a list, where the latest is on top. Update your browser to empty this list.
